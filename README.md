<h1>K MeanS from Scratch</h1>

<list>
<u1>This is an implementation of k means algorithm using python. My effort has been to implement the algorithm without using sklearn.</u1>
<u2>The current python file uses numpy and matplotlib mainly, the data is self created and can be replaced by some other data in numpy array format, the code uses an inbuilt function to identify an optimum value of the k means paramenter - 'k'. This reduces the effort of the user, but for the convenience of user, the elbow plot is provided</u2>
